Owen, a college freshman juggling studies and his passion for gaming, stumbled upon the site through a YouTube ad. The idea of getting a free $100 Xbox gift card felt like a lifeline—he’d been eyeing a new game, but his budget was tight. Seeing so many positive reviews and screenshots of “successful” redemptions on social media, Owen couldn’t help but be intrigued. After all, the site was ranked as one of the “best” free gift card generators.

With a bit of hesitation, Owen clicked on the link. The site loaded quickly, and the interface looked professional. He entered his Xbox username, selected a $100 gift card, and watched as the generator whirred to life. Moments later, a code popped up on the screen, seemingly ready to be redeemed. Excited, Owen copied the code and opened his Xbox account to claim his reward.

However, when he entered the code, an error message appeared: **“Invalid Code.”** Frustration bubbled up, but before he could try again, Owen received an alert from Microsoft about unusual activity on his account. His Xbox account had been flagged for suspicious login attempts from multiple locations.

Panic set in. The site, which had appeared legitimate, was just another scam. Owen quickly changed his passwords and spent the rest of the day locking down his accounts.
